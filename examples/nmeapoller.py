"""
nmeapoller.py

This example illustrates how to read, write and display NMEA messages
"concurrently" using threads and queues. This represents a useful
generic pattern for many end user applications.

Usage:

python3 nmeapoller.py port=/dev/ttyACM0 baudrate=38400 timeout=3

It implements two threads which run concurrently:
1) an I/O thread which continuously reads NMEA data from the
receiver and sends any queued outbound command or poll messages.
2) a process thread which processes parsed NMEA data - in this example
it simply prints the parsed data to the terminal.
NMEA data is passed between threads using queues.

Press CTRL-C to terminate.

FYI: Since Python implements a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL),
threads are not strictly concurrent, though this is of minor
practical consequence here.
