NMEA Protocol Set payload definitions

THESE ARE THE PAYLOAD DEFINITIONS FOR _SET_ MESSAGES _TO_ THE RECEIVER
(e.g. Configuration commands).

NB: Attribute names must be unique within each message id.
NB: Avoid reserved names 'msgID', 'talker', 'payload', 'checksum'.

NB: Repeating groups must be defined as a tuple thus
    'group': ('numr', {dict})
    where
    - 'numr' is either:
       a) an integer representing a fixed number of repeats e.g 32
       b) a string representing the name of a preceding attribute
          containing the number of repeats e.g. 'numCh'
       c) 'None' for an indeterminate repeating group
          (only one such group is permitted per message type)
    - {dict} is the nested dictionary containing the repeating
      attributes
